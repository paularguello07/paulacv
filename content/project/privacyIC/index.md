![screen reader text](/privacy/full_method.png "Proposed end-to-end model. The optical encoder incorporates a camera with a refractive lens, which is parametrized by a linear combination of Zernike polynomials. The decoder is formed by a convolutional feature extraction and an LSTM Network with attention, which produces a caption from the private image")

**Scene captioning**, the task of describing visual information using text, typically relies on high-resolution images, raising privacy concerns due to potential exposure of sensitive data like facial attributes. This project introduces a novel solution to protect privacy by integrating optics design with algorithms, using a learned refractive lens to obscure sensitive visual attributes in the acquired image while still enabling accurate scene captions. 📸🔒

### Key Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Lens:** A specially designed lens that distorts sensitive attributes, such as faces, ethnicity, and gender, ensuring privacy before image acquisition.
- **Optimized Deep Learning:** Combines an optimized refractive lens with a deep network architecture for end-to-end scene captioning from distorted images. 🤖🔍
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Validated through extensive simulations and hardware experiments, showing a superior balance between privacy and utility.
